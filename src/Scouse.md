| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **800 g** - 800g diced beef (I used rump, chuck is probably better)  | **3** - Potatoes, diced |

## Procedimento

1. Start by heating the oil in a large pot you have the lid for. Once itâ€™s hot, add the beef and season with salt. 
2. As soon as you have good colour on the beef, add the onions and cook for 3-4 minutes or until they just start to change colour. 
3. Add the bitter beer and reduce by 1/2. 
4. Add the rest of the veg, stir well and season with salt. 
5. Pour in the beef stock and bring to a simmer. 
6. Cook with the lid on for 2 hours. 
7. After 2 hours, remove the lid and cook for a further hour or until the beef is fork-tender. 
8. Serve with buttered bread and pickled red cabbage.
