| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **3 pounds** - Potatoes | **1 teasp** - Origano |
| **\\(\frac{1}{3}\\) cup** - Olive oil | **\\(\frac{1}{2}\\) teasp** - Ground black pepper |

## Procedimento

> Preheat the oven to 200Â°

1. Cut the potatoes lengthwise in quarters (about 1 inch thick).
1. Put potato wedges in a large bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and lemon juice and toss to coat. Season with salt, oregano, and black pepper (optionally the original recipe calls for lots of garlic); toss again to coat.
1. Spread potato wedges in a single layer in a 2-inch-deep pan. Pour chicken broth over potatoes.
1. Roast potatoes in the preheated oven until tender and golden brown, about 1 hour.

## Note

### Pro Tip

Be sure to cut your potatoes into evenly sized wedges so they cook at the same rate. Make them thick enough to keep their shape after absorbing all of the pan juices.

### Why aren't my potatoes crispy?

These potatoes are supposed to be more tender than crispy, but if you like crispy potatoes, switch your oven to broil after baking them. Broil for about 4 minutes, being sure to watch them closely so they do not over-crisp or burn.
