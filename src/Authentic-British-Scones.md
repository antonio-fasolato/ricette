## Ingredienti

| Ingredienti                  | Ingredienti             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **250 g** - All purpose flour (2 cups) | **160 g** - Milk (\\(\frac{2}{3}\\) cup) |
| **25 g** - Sugar (2 tbsp) | **1** - Egg yolk beaten with 1 tbsp milk (to glaze) |
| **2,45 g** - Baking powder (4 tsp) | Strawberry jam (to serve) |
| **2 g** - Salt (\\(\frac{1}{2}\\) tsp) | Clotted cream, at room temperature (to serve) |
| **40 g** - Unsalted butter, cold (3 tbsp)| |

## Procedimento

> Preriscaldare il forno a 220Â°

1. In a medium bowl, place the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and butter. Rub the mixture together with your fingers to break up the butter, until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.
1. Add the milk slowly, mixing as you add, using enough of the milk to get your dough to come together with no lumps remaining. (Your dough should be quite sticky. If a good consistency is not achieved with the listed amount of milk, continue adding until your dough reaches a good consistency.)
1. Spoon the dough out until a well-floured surface. Generously dust the top of the dough and knead the dough 2-3 times to coat it with flour and smooth the surface. Press the dough into a round that is roughly 1 inch thick.
1. Using a well-floured cookie cutter, cut the dough into 2 inch circles. (Be sure to press the cookie cutter straight down and up. Twisting the cookie cutter will impact the amount of rise you get on your scones.) 
1. Place the rounds onto a greased and floured baking sheet. Brush them gently with the egg yolk and milk mixture.
1. Bake the scones for 12-15 minutes, until golden and firm.
1. Remove the baked scones from the oven and let them cool for 30 minutes (if you can resist). If you like softer scones, cover them with a clean tea towel as they cool.


## Note

This scone batter freezes well. We like to freeze pre-cut rounds of dough for easy baking (just thaw and bake as directed). Alternately, freeze the baked scones and reheat in a low oven for 5-10 minutes after thawing on the counter.
