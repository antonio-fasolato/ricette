## Procedimento

1. Slice peeled potatoes and run through a food processor fitted with the grater attachment. Place shredded potatoes in a cheesecloth and wring, extracting as much moisture as possible.
1. Measure 2 cups shredded, drained potatoes and place into a medium bowl; save any extra for another use. Add egg, flour, onion, and salt, and stir until well combined.
2. Heat \\(\frac{1}{4}\\) inch of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Place large spoonfuls of potato mixture into the hot oil, pressing down on them to form \\(\frac{1}{4}\\) to \\(\frac{1}{2}\\) inch-thick patties. Cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. 
3. Flip and repeat on the other side.
4. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain while you cook any remaining latkes. Serve hot.
