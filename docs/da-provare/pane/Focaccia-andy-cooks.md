## Ingredienti

| Ingredienti                  | Ingredienti             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **500 g** - Flour | **2** - Onions, sliced thick |
| **4 g** - Salt | **25** - Cloves of garlic, peeled |
| **4 g** - Sugar | Olive oil |
| **7 g** - Yeast | **100 g** - Blue cheese |
| **325 g** - Water | |

## Procedimento

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer (or just a normal bowl if you don't have a mixer), add the flour, salt, sugar, and yeast, and whisk. 
2. Next, add the hook attachment (or wooden spoon) and turn to medium, stream in room temperature water and mix until the dough comes together and is smooth. This should take about 7-8 minutes in a mixer. 
3. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and bring it together into a ball, then grease the mixing bowl with some olive oil and place the dough back into the bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave in a warm spot to proof for an hour or until it has doubled in size. 
4. Once doubled, turn out and fold it on itself, then in an oven dish drizzle 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil and place the dough into the dish. 
5. Push the dough out so it stretches to all the sides, cover the dish and leave the dough to prove again for an hour. 
6. While that is proving, place the garlic into an oven-safe dish with some thyme, salt, and olive oil, and bake at 140°C (284°F) for 40 minutes, remove and leave to cool at room temperature. 

> Preheat your oven to 200°C (392°F). 

7. Take the thick-sliced onions and place them onto an oven tray, drizzle with oil and season with salt on both sides. 
8. Bake in the 200°C (392°F) oven for 10-12 minutes or until cooked through and starting to soften. 
9. Once the dough has proven, drizzle some of the warm garlic oil on top and use your fingertips to poke a bunch of holes into the dough. 
10. Use these holes to add the confit garlic, then top with the onions and blue cheese. 
11. Bake at 200°C (392°F) for 25 minutes or until the bread is cooked and golden brown on top
