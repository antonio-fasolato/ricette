5. Add the Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute.

7. Add the broth, frozen peas and carrots, and frozen corn. Bring the liquid to a boil then reduce to simmer.

18. Spread it out into an even layer. 
19. Spoon the mashed potatoes on top of the meat. Carefully spread into an even layer.
20. If the baking dish looks very full, place it on a rimmed baking sheet so that the filling doesnâ€™t bubble over into your oven. 
21. Bake uncovered for 25-30 minutes.
22. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
